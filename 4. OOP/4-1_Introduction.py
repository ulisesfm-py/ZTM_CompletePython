# We can create our own data types

# OOP is coding parts of a whole, in a way that we can combine, reuse
# and structure our code in parts

# Let's create a new class


class BigObject:
    # Code
    pass


obj1 = BigObject()  # instanciate
obj2 = BigObject()  # instanciate
obj3 = BigObject()  # instanciate

print(type(obj1))

# A class is the blueprint of what we wanna create
# What are the basic attributes, methods or actions

# Objects are instances that we can create or instantiate using
# that rolemodel or class

# Every time a create an object such as a list, I can access to multiple
# methods that are common to a class
