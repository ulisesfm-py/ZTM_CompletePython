# ZTM Complete Python Developer Course

Complete Python developer course by ZTM. This are my lectures notes and projects from this course.

This course is taught by Andrei Neagoie.

These lecture notes were written by someone who was learning along the course, so don't trust them too much.
This is just my strategy to remember things and collect what I thought was going to be useful for me.

The titles of the .py files and folders might not be Python friendly.
